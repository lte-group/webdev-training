# Main Project

The previous exercises were intended to build knowledge and skills in the fundamental building blocks of the web. Now using those skills you should be able to take a set of requirements and build out the related UI.

## Brief

The goal of this training is to run through learning the basics of web development and then design and build a web page which will show a list of news items and then a news detail page to display the news item.

Once this is complete then we will build out a backend solution using Django to store and serve these news stories.

### News Index page

The news index should have the following:
* a banner with an image and title with intro text
* left hand section showing a list of news categories
* right section with a grid of news stories with links to news detail pages
* each item in the list of news should contain the following:
** an image
** date of publication
** title

### News Detail page

Each news detail page should contain the following:
* an image
* title
* date of publication
* author name
* author image
* news article content
* related news section

## Planning

We need to break this project down into 3 main phases, these are as follows:
* create design flats
* build html and css from the flats
* build out a backend solution
