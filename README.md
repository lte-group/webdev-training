# Web Development

## Introduction

There are a number of roles in web development and it is useful to be aware of the kinds of roles that are available. Depending on the nature and size of each organisation you may find that some of these roles overlap or a job role may incorporate several of these roles:

**[Overview Job Roles](./docs/job-roles.md)**

The backbone of the web is built on HTML, CSS and Javascript. Knowledge of these three technologies are essential for many roles in web development:

**[Introduction to Web Development](./into-to-web.md)**

On top of these technologies you are likely to come across other programming languages which are used in the back end, such as Python, PHP, Java or Ruby.

## Brief

The goal of this training is to run through learning the basics of web development and then design and build a web page which will show a list of news items and then a news detail page to display the news item.

Once this is complete then we will build out a backend solution using Django to store and serve these news stories.

### News Index page

The news index should have the following:
* a banner with an image and title with intro text
* left hand section showing a list of news categories
* right section with a grid of news stories with links to news detail pages
* each item in the list of news should contain the following:
** an image
** date of publication
** title

### News Detail page

Each news detail page should contain the following:
* an image
* title
* date of publication
* author name
* author image
* news article content
* related news section

## Planning

We need to break this project down into 3 main phases, these are as follows:
* create design flats
* build html and css from the flats
* build out a backend solution
