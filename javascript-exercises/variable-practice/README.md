# Variable Practice

## Exercise Overview

Create variables to store your name, age, and favorite color, then display them in the console.

## Objectives

- Understand how to declare variables in JavaScript
- Learn the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`
- Practice using `console.log()` to output values
- Work with different data types (strings, numbers)

## Key Concepts

- Variable declaration (`let`, `const`, `var`)
- String data type
- Number data type
- Console output

## Tasks

1. Create a variable to store your name (string)
2. Create a variable to store your age (number)
3. Create a variable to store your favorite color (string)
4. Display each variable in the console
5. Try combining variables in a single console.log statement

## Tips

- Use `const` for values that won't change
- Use `let` for values that might change
- Avoid using `var` in modern JavaScript
- You can use template literals (backticks) to combine strings and variables: `` `My name is ${name}` ``
- Open the browser's Developer Tools (F12) to see the console output

## Example Output

```
John Doe
30
Blue
My name is John Doe, I am 30 years old, and my favorite color is Blue.
```

## Extension Challenges

- Create additional variables for hobbies, city, or occupation
- Practice string concatenation using both `+` operator and template literals
- Experiment with different data types (boolean, arrays)
